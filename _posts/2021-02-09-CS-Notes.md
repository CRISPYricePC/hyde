title: My University Notes, Online
---

I've created a repository to store my notes for this semester of university. I originally thought i would make the repo public to be viewed on GitHub/Lab, but I decided it would be more fun to just make it part of this website. You can view the notes at [notes.benmitchell.dev](https://notes.benmitchell.dev), hopefully this will make me be slightly more productive than the dumpster fire that was last semester.

Okay bye now.
