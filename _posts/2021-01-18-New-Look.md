title: A New Look

I've decided to update the look of the site to something more stylish. This is coinciding with a New-Year's Resolution aimed at making this place more informational. All the previous blog posts are still readable, just scroll.

Also! The source code for this site is available on my [GitHub]({{ site.github.repo }}), something that was missing with my previous site.
