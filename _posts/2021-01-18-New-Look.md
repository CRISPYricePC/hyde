title: A New Look
---

I've decided to update the look of the site to something more stylish. This is coinciding with a New-Year's Resolution aimed at making this place more informational. All the previous blog posts are still readable, just scroll.

Also! The source code for this site is available on my [GitHub]({{ site.github.repo }}), something that was missing with my previous site. If you're wondering how I came to this design, read on:

I started with a fork of GitHub user Poole's excellent [Hyde Theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde) for the [Jekyll static site generator](https://jekyllrb.com/). From there, I tweaked the colours to match the [Nord scheme](https://www.nordtheme.com/), which is currently my favourite colour scheme. I've also switched main paragraph font out from <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Helvetica Neue</span> to <span style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">Roboto Slab</span>, which is a much nicer font in my opinion. Code blocks have also been modified to fit the Nord scheme, but also the font has been changed to `JetBrains Mono`, which you can find more information about [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).
